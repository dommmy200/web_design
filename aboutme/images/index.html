    <h2>Dominic Abah</h2>
    <h2>Nickname: The Rainmaker</h2>
    <p> I am avid and enthusiastic seeker of knowledge in whatever form it presents itself.
        I love socializing with like-minded people, regardless of their deferring background. 
        I am currently pursuing a carrier in Software Development, although I am in the formative
        years of studies.

    <p>
        I am married with four lovely boys. I am currently a civil servant in hope of eventually
        making a detour into IT in few years to come. On the spiritual realm, I hope to well equipped
        with the scriptural knowledge that I am currently learning to be a great father to my 
        children, a good influence to my colleagues and friends.

        By next month I will be a year old as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
        Saint
